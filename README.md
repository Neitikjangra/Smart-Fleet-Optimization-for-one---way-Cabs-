🚖 TEBIN — Smart Fleet Optimization for One-Way Cabs

Revolutionizing urban mobility with AI-powered predictive analytics

TEBIN is an intelligent fleet management platform designed to optimize cab dispatching, routing, and operations. By leveraging deep learning and reinforcement learning models, TEBIN minimizes empty runs, predicts demand hotspots, and ensures efficient EV utilization — making transport smarter, faster, and more sustainable.

🚀 Key Features

🔹 AI-Powered Demand Prediction
Predicts upcoming ride demand using GCN + LSTM models trained on real-time city and ride data.

🔹 Smart Dispatch System
Automatically assigns the best driver based on proximity, traffic, and profitability.

🔹 Live Route Optimization
Dynamic routing powered by real-time traffic feeds and adaptive pathfinding for each vehicle.

🔹 Golden Parking Points
Identifies ideal parking zones where cabs are most likely to get their next ride faster.

🔹 EV Fleet Intelligence
Optimizes charging schedules and routes for electric vehicles to maximize uptime and efficiency.
